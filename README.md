## Nspire Tips
- Use Documents to organize your math & notes.
 - I recommend one document per unit, with one Nspire "Problem" for each problem on the probelm set, day, and test.
 - After downloading these notes to your Nspire, copy the problem into the last Problem in your current unit's document. This way you can quickly reference the notes while doing classwork or taking the unit test.
- Use ctrl and the D-Pad to quickly switch between pages in a document.

 ## Filename & Version Structure
 Filename: "Notes \[Unit-#\].\[Revision-#\].tns"
 
 So "Notes 4.2.tns" is the second revision of notes updated for Unit 4.
